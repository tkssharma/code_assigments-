External Merge Sort
External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into sort data and save it on hard disk 

sorting 900 megabytes 
RAM : 100 mb

1) Read 100 MB of data at a time and store that on disk 
2 ) Now we have 9 chunks stored on memory 
3) 9 chunks having 100 mb each

Now get first 10 MB of each chunk 
*10 mb of each chunk 90 MB and sort data 
similarly do it 10 times 

Keep output memory as 10 MB IF FULL GET NEXT 10 MB
